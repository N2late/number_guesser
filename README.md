# Number Guesser

- My first project at the Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer path.

## Details

Small guessing game played between the computer and the user in order to guess a target number. The one with the guess closer to it wins. 

### Note: 
 - The script.js was made by me. 
 - The other files were provided by Codecademy to solve the project.
